	<p>A new year means a chance to begin again. Many of us will make New Year's Resolutions over the next few days. Whether it
		is a project to start, a few pounds to lose, or a relationship to mend most of us see the New Year as a time to reset and
		restart. </p>
	<p>Let me encourage you to do just that in your relationship with Jesus. Maybe you've never had a consistent time of daily
		Bible reading and prayer. The New Year is the perfect time to start. Perhaps you need to commit to consistent, faithful
		attendance in a LIFE group or worship. January is a great time to start giving obediently through tithing. It is also a
		great time to reconnect with people who are far from God by inviting them to church or having a spiritual conversation
		with them.</p>

		On Wednesday night, January 10, we relaunch Family Nights for the Winter/Spring semester. All of our age group
		activities will relaunch. Brady Collier and I will continue the study of 1 Corinthians. In addition, we have classes for
		adults, Oneighty students, and AWANA plus Kidzpraise for children. There is something for everyone on Wednesday nights
		at all three of our campuses. </p>
	<p>On Sunday, January 14, I am diving into a new sermon series. For a few weeks, we are going to explore how God wants to fill
		us with peace, power, and wisdom through the Holy Spirit. We are to be "infused" with the Spirit of God. Unfortunately,
		when many people talk about the Holy Spirit they are more "confused" than "infused." We will open
		up God's Word to see the exciting truth of what the Spirit filled life really looks like. I hope you will be here in every
		service and in LIFE groups to learn more.</p>
