	<p>Our mission is to develop fully devoted Christ-Followers and share the message of Jesus Christ with everyone.</p>
	<h3>WORSHIP</h3>
	<p>We love God and we love helping people experience the joy of living for God. Join us in discovering how much He loves us
		and in learning how to go through life with our eyes fixed on Him.</p>
	<h3>COMMUNITY</h3>
	<p>Following Jesus is an individual decision, but the journey is best made in good company. We believe that joining a group
		is one of the best ways to grow closer to Jesus.</p>
	<h3>SERVING</h3>
	<p>Jesus said that after loving God with everything we have, the most important thing we can do is love our neighbors. As we
		become more like Him, we are inspired to use our lives to serve others.</p>
